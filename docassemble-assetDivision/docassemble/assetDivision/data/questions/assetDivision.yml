question: |
  **Property Division** 
subquestion: |
  Normally, separating couples can work out a separation of property that they both feel is fair. But remember, until a judge signs off on your agreement and issues a final order, your property and debts still belong to both of you and do not become separate even if you have agreed on how to divide them between yourselves.

  When you divide your property and debt, you should come up with an agreement that divides everything fairly equally, so that you each end up with roughly the same value of your property (and debt). Dividing your property does not necessarily mean a physical division.

  On the following pages, you will be asked to:
  
  - (1) List ALL of your and ${resp}'s assets (aka property) and debts, and 
  - (2) Propose how you'd like to divide these assets and debts between you and ${resp} 
  
  A good way to start is to make a list of everything that you own. Please note that you and ${resp} must declare all assets and debts to the other. The most important thing to do is to be open and honest in listing everything of value you own. If you keep anything hidden, it tends to come to the surface sooner or later, and the penalties for hiding something of value can be very serious.

question: |
  **Property Division:** Community vs. Separate Property 
subquestion: |
  In order to request property division orders, you will need to categorize each asset and debt as either community or separate property. See our [video explaining Separate vs. Community Property](link Youtube video). 
  
  **What is Community Property?** 
  
  Any property acquired between your date of marriage and date of separation is presumed to be community property (unless such property qualifies as separate property under the law), and belongs to both you and ${resp}. Community property also includes separate property that is changed to community property after marriage in compliance with the law (*read [California Family Code Section 852](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=852.&lawCode=FAM) on transmutation*). 
  
  **What is Separate Property?**
  
  Separate property refers to all property acquired by you or ${resp} (1) before your date of marriage; (2) after your date of separation; (3) by gift or inheritance at any time; (4) between your date of marriage and date of separation and acquired with separate property; or (5) that is initially acquired as community property but subsequently changed separate property in compliance with the law. 
  
  For more information, please click the following links to navigate to the California Family Code's definitions of: 
  
  - [Separate Property](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&sectionNum=770.); 
  - [Community Property](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&sectionNum=760.); and
  - [Quasi-Community Property](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&sectionNum=125.).  
  
  We recommend that you to read California [Family Code Sections 760-853](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&division=4.&title=&part=2.&chapter=1.&article=&goUp=Y) regarding Characterization of Marital Property, and also [California Family Code Section 70](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=70.&lawCode=FAM) which defines “date of separation.”

question: |
  **Property Division:** Assets
subquestion: |
  On the following pages, you will be asked to list and categorize each of your assets, including the following information about each: 
  
  **Date Acquired:** the date that you and/or ${resp} obtained ownership of the asset. 
  
  - If you do not know the exact date, you can list a month and year or write "before marriage," "during marriage," or "after separation." However, make sure that whatever you list makes it clear whether or not the asset or debt should be considered separate or community property. 
  - For example, if your date of separation was July 4, 2022, you could not list "July 2022" as the date of acquisition, because this is not specific enough to determine whether the asset was acquired during the marriage or after the date of separation.  
  
  **Gross Fair Market Value:** the current value you estimate an asset is worth. 
  
  - If you don't know an asset's worth, do some research online for the same or similar assets and look for the price at which they are currently selling.
  - When you list the current gross fair market value, please note that you must list the current value of the items (*think, how much could I get for this at a garage sale or on Craigslist?*), NOT the value that you purchased the item at or how much it would cost to replace it.  
  
  **Amount of Debt:** how much money is still owed on the purchase of an asset.
  
  - For example, if you bought a car for $11,000, but have a remaining loan of $4,000, you would write $4,000 under *Amout of Debt*.
